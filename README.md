coref_draft
=============

Description
----------
Implementation of Stanford multi-seive coreference resolution approach for Dutch.
This is a draft version of the code. An official first release will be made available on github/cltl upon completion and basic testing of the first version of the system.


Current implementation
----------------------

The current implementation works on naf input files parsed by Alpino (i.e. it works for Dutch).

Future plans:

- separate Alpino specific functions from general naf-extraction functions (extend to other languages)
- create library for English
